# Product Management Assignment

## What is it ?
Hello! Thank you for your interest in the Cloudflare Product Management Internship Program. . This two to three hour exercise is designed to allow you to demonstrate just how you approach product management decisions.

## Requirements
You are the Product Manager tasked with answering this question: Should Cloudflare Workers build a development platform for mobile developers? Naturally this question sparks several more-- What value can mobile developers get from building on Cloudflare Workers? What tools are they using today? What should we build to make the value even more compelling? Is there a compelling enough market to justify building something new?

1. Learn what you can about Cloudflare Workers. It might be a good idea to try out the tutorial or engineering challenge. Google, our community site, and Stack Overflow are also useful resources.

2. Research the mobile industry. Learn more about how mobile developers choose the technologies they use, what needs they have, and what problems they are trying to solve.

Submit your case on why (or not) Cloudflare Workers should target mobile developers, and what features we’d need to add to capture more of that market. The cases should be a maximum of two pages.

* Plans to learn more about the market and its needs
* Product changes or additions you believe might be valuable
* Goals to measure the success of what you build
* Risks which might lead to its failure

## Suggestions / Hints

* Have a thesis. What are the one or two foundational beliefs which will allow this product to win the market? Know what problem it is solving and for whom.
* Everything is an experiment and a hypothesis. Describe your vision even if it might not end up being correct, but don’t hold it with too much conviction.
* Be specific! It’s easy to say that the product should be ‘easier to use’, but if you’ve done your research you should have specific suggestions and theories. Specifics can be argued with and improved, generalities aren’t all that valuable.


## Submitting your project

When submitting your project, you should submit your proposal to Greenhouse. The preferred method for doing this is to create a PDF file that includes the entire proposal.
